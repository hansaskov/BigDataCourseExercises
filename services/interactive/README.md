# Interactive containers

This folder contains components for creating a custom image that can be used to interact with HDFS by a Python client, to run other commands, and to create files using Visual Studio Code inside Kubernetes.  

The deployment manifest `anbae-big-data-course.yaml` includes a pod definition for the interactive container and two other resources used to claim persistent storage in Kubernetes.

The following cmd below can be used for creating a temporary instance of the image.
```
kubectl run anbae --rm -i --tty --image anderslaunerbaek/anbae-big-data-course:latest -- bash
```

## Attach Visual Studio Code to a running container
One convenient approach for making development inside Kubernetes is to attach Visual Studio Code to a running container. An introduction to this concept can be found here: [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).   
You will need the following three extensions to make this work. All of them are developed by Microsoft. 

- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)



A Kubernetes icon will appear in the activity bar after the installation of the mentioned extensions. The image below illustrates how to attach Visual Studio Code to the container.

This will open a new vscode window that is connected to the pod.
